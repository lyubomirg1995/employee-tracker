## Description

This employee-tracker aims to simplify the process of employee management for businesses, filling the gap of an accessible and user-friendly tool for handling personnel data. Developing this application, I improved my knowledge of Node.js, Inquirer, and MySQL integrations. What sets this application apart is its simple design, ensuring that those with little to no technical expertise can interact with large quantities of information, making data management easy for any business.
